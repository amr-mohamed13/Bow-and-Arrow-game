## Overview

Bow and Arrow Game is a sophisticated 2D archery simulation developed using the Processing framework. This project demonstrates advanced game development concepts including physics simulation, collision detection, and state management.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- Realistic arrow trajectory physics
- Dynamic wind effects on projectile motion
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Comprehensive scoring system
- Multiple game modes

### Technical Features
- Object-oriented architecture
- Event-driven game loop
- Collision detection system
- State management
- Resource management for assets

## Gameplay

### Controls
- **Aim**: Mouse movement
- **Draw Bow**: Click and hold
- **Shoot**: Release mouse button
- **Reset**: Press 'R' key
- **Pause**: Press 'P' key

### Objectives
1. Hit targets to accumulate points
2. Complete level-specific challenges
3. Achieve high scores
4. Unlock new levels and features
